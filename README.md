In a doctor appointment system for patients using PHP and MySQL, the workflow typically involves the following components:

1) Patient Registration and Login: Patients can register for an account with their personal information and log in securely to access their profiles.

2) Doctor Listings and Availability: Patients can view a list of available doctors, including their specialties, available appointment times, and locations.

3) Booking an Appointment: Patients can select a doctor and choose an available time slot to book an appointment. The system stores the patient ID, doctor ID, date, and time of the appointment in the database.

4) Appointment Details and History: Patients can view details of upcoming appointments and access their appointment history, including notes from previous consultations.
